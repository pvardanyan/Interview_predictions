# Interview application predictions
This model must the people into 2 groups: who can enter the interview and who can't. We'll use 3 ML models to solve this classification task.

# Starting with imports
we'll use these libraries/modules

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Scikit Learn ->
                 preprocessing (OrdinalEncoder , StandardScaler)
                 model_selection (train_test_split)
                 metrics (accuracy_score)
                 linear_model (LogisticRegression)
                 naive_bayes (GaussianNB)
                 kneighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
6. plotly
